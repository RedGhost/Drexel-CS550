### Common File(s) ###
  README                    - The file you are currently reading.
  makefile                  - Makefile with view/build/clean commands
  java-cup-11a.jar          - .jar libraries for cup (included since they're not installed on tux)
  java-cup-11a-runtime.jar  - .jar libraries for cup (included since they're not installed on tux)

### Part 1 ###
- view cmd: 'make view'
- build:    'make compile'
- details:
  The compile method requires a file or instructions to be given. When that happens it will generate
  a non-linked file (trans.out) a fully linked an runnable file (link.out), an optimized linked file
  (optimized.out), and an initial memory file (initialmemory.out). These files can be run using the
  RAL interpreter to produce the desired effect. 
- Viewing files:
  Once make compile is run you can view the various files that were produced using this command:
  make view-trans   - displays the pre-linked file
  make view-op      - displays the optimized linked file
  make view-link    - displays the linked file
- Running files using the RAL interpreter:
  make run          - runs the unoptimized linked file using the initial memory file
  make run-op       - runs the optimized linked file using the initial memory file
- Source File(s):
  interpreterext.cup  - cup grammar file
  interpreterext.flex - jflex scanner file
  Program.java        - Code file containing class definitions
  SymbolTable.java    - Maintains the symbols used in the program
  Translator.java     - Translates the symbols to RAL instructions

### Testing ###
Testing was done by running against the sample input files.
